# DDoS attack 

## Introduction 

**DDoS Attack** means ```Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack``` , it is a malicious **cyberattack** in which the attacker attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by *overwhelming the flood of Internet traffic* to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites

It involves the orchestration of multiple compromised devices, known as a [botnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet), to launch a coordinated assault on a target system. These devices can include computers, servers, IoT devices, and even smartphones that have been infected with malware, allowing attackers to control them remotely. By harnessing the collective power of the botnet, attackers can generate an overwhelming flood of traffic, exhausting the targetâ€™s resources and causing a **denial of service**.

## Types of DDoS Attacks

There are three common types of DDoS attacks:

### Volumetric Attacks

These attacks overwhelm the network bandwidth with a flood of malicious traffic by sending enormous amounts of traffic to a targeted server, causing network congestion, packet loss, and service disruptions The goal is to consume all available bandwidth, rendering the service unavailable .The attacks are measured in bits per second (bps) or Gigabits per second (Gbps).

**Examples :** 

- ICMP floods
- DNS reflection floods
- UDP floods
- TCP out-of-state floods (**SYN**, **SYN-ACK**, **ACK**, etc.)
- Reflection amplification attacks

### Protocol Attacks

These attacks exploit weaknesses in network protocols to consume server resources or disrupt the connection between machines.

**Examples:**
- SYN Flood
- Ping of Death


### Application Layer Attacks

These attacks target the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model) where common internet requests such as HTTP GET and HTTP POST occur to disrupt specific services or applications.

**Types of application-layer attacks :**
- Denial-of-service attacks
- Slowloris attacks
- BGP hijacking
- Flood attacks
- Zero-day attacks


## Datasets for DDoS Research

### CAIDA Anonymized Internet Traces

**Description** : 

This dataset contains approximately one hour of anonymized traffic traces from a DDoS attack on August 4, 2007 (20:50:08 UTC to 21:56:16 UTC). This type of denial-of-service attack attempts to block access to the targeted server by consuming computing resources on the server and by consuming all of the bandwidth of the network connecting the server to the Internet.

The one-hour trace is split up in 5-minute pcap files. The total size of the dataset is **5.3 GB** (compressed; 21 GB uncompressed). Only attack traffic to the victim and responses to the attack from the victim are included in the traces. Non-attack traffic has as much as possible been removed. Traces in this dataset are anonymized using **CryptoPAn** prefix-preserving anonymization using a single key. The payload has been removed from all packets.

**Usage** :
Useful for studying network-wide impact and traffic patterns during DDoS attacks.
